# Channels the bot joins on startup.  If CHANNELS contains nothing, the bot will not
# join channels after connecting to irc network
# Usual syntax:
# CHANNELS = #perl #foo #bar
# Syntax for networks that let users join many channels at once, ala "/join #chan1,#chan2,#chan3":
# CHANNELS = #perl,#foo,#bar
# Using the second method, make sure there are NO spaces in the string
# Otherwise the bot will join "#perl," and then "#foo," and then #bar, which
# probably isn't what's wanted

# Example: RUNAS_LOCAL_USER is set to "chrisbot".  Userland user "chris" can't start the bot unless he uses
